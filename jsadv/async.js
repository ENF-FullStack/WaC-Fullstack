// 1) Implement a buildStringAsync-function that works in the background until the string
//    is completed. You will need to use setTimeout. 
//    How can you get the return value from the function?

// 2) Implement version of buildSringAsync that returns a "promise object"
//    that will later on contain the value from the async functionality

// 3) Study the use of ES6 Promise-object from mdn. Could you implement a version of 
//	  buildString with that?
//    You can also peek filedemo.js....
